### Task 1 - EDA
Using this dataset, you are supposed to prepare an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report

in PDF format that shows at least 3 different insights about this data (number of examples

per class, top frequent n-grams generally and per class, lengths of examples in words and

letters, ....) . Feel free to show your insights in a good format (description, tables, charts,
...).
Note that you can prepare the PDF manually after generating the analytics in any other
format (CSV, xls, doc), ...).

Note: Use stories data only (not comments).

### Task 3 - Classification
Using the same data in task 2, build a machine learning based classifier and show its

performance on the test-set. Show precision, recall, f-score, accuracy for each class and for

the whole test data. Please describe briefly the meaning of each result and metric for this

specific task. Also, please write some enhancements that you may think about to achieve
better results.

Note: add a readme file that describes the whole training process in briefed points. Note:

Use stories data only (not comments). Also, take the last 20% of each file as a test-set.
